2.3.3 (Dec 07, 2016)
Ruby 2.3.3

Packages will be provided in two versions:
32bits (x86) and 64bits (x64).

Same DevKit used for version 2.0.0 is required for this version.
Important information

Choosing 32bits vs 64bits

Before you download a 64bits version (labeled x64), it is important you understand that not all gems, libraries or tools have been tested for this version.

Things are pretty close, however it is still our recommendation you use a 32bit release.

If you have a 64bits version of Windows, you can still use 32bits, as there is no performance issue around it.
Ruby 2.3.X is brand new

While officially 2.3 is stable, that doesn't mean all the software will magically work on it.

Use 2.3 for development and verify your application, scripts and tools works properly before deciding to run this in your production environment.
Existing pre-compiled gems might not be Ruby 2.# compatible

Ruby 2.3 introduced some C API changes which means compiled C extensions with previous versions of Ruby may not run against Ruby 2.3.

DO NOT install Ruby 2.3 on top of existing Ruby 2.2.x or earlier, or try to use compiled extensions with it.

You will be required to force compilation of those gems:

gem install <name> --platform=ruby

This will require you have the extra dependencies installed for that gem to compile. Look at the gem documentation for the requirements.

Please check each gem documentation and recent releases.
Do not use other DevKit version than the one recommended

This version of Ruby has been compiled and optimized for mingw-w64 GCC 4.7.2.

Use of another version of DevKit package to compile gems might result in compilation issues during gem installation or simply segfaults.

Look for the DevKit installers identified with the name 'DevKit-mingw64-32' and 'DevKit-mingw64-64' for 32 and 64 bits respectively.

To be clear:

    Download and install DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2 for 32bits Ruby
    Download and install DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2 for 64bits Ruby

Known Issues

There are some issues with Development Kit configuration process that fails
to detect x64 installations of Ruby. You will need to manually edit
config.yml for it to work. See the following issues for details:

Choosing 32bits vs 64bits

Before you download a 64bits version (labeled x64), it is important you understand that not all gems, libraries or tools have been tested for this version.

Things are pretty close, however it is still our recommendation you use a 32bit release.

If you have a 64bits version of Windows, you can still use 32bits, as there is no performance issue around it.
Existing pre-compiled gems might not be Ruby 2.2 compatible

Ruby 2.2 introduced some C API changes which means compiled C extensions with previous versions of Ruby may not run against Ruby 2.2.

DO NOT install Ruby 2.2 on top of existing Ruby 2.1.x or earlier, or try to use compiled extensions with it.

You will be required to force compilation of those gems:

gem install <name> --platform=ruby

This will require you have the extra dependencies installed for that gem to compile. Look at the gem documentation for the requirements.

Please check each gem documentation and recent releases.
Do not use other DevKit version than the one recommended

This version of Ruby has been compiled and optimized for mingw-w64 GCC 4.7.2.

Use of another version of DevKit package to compile gems might result in compilation issues during gem installation or simply segfaults.

Look for the DevKit installers identified with the name 'DevKit-mingw64-32' and 'DevKit-mingw64-64' for 32 and 64 bits respectively.

To be clear:

    Download and install DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2 for 32bits Ruby
    Download and install DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2 for 64bits Ruby

Known Issues

There are some issues with Development Kit configuration process that fails
to detect x64 installations of Ruby. You will need to manually edit
config.yml for it to work. See the following issues for details:

Ruby 2.2.x is brand new

While officially 2.2.x is stable, that doesn't mean all the software will magically work on it.

Use 2.2.3 for development and verify your application, scripts and tools works properly before deciding to run this in your production environment.
Existing pre-compiled gems might not be Ruby 2.2 compatible

Ruby 2.2 introduced some C API changes which means compiled C extensions with previous versions of Ruby may not run against Ruby 2.2.

This will require you have the extra dependencies installed for that gem to compile. Look at the gem documentation for the requirements.

Please check each gem documentation and recent releases.
Do not use other DevKit version than the one recommended

This version of Ruby has been compiled and optimized for mingw-w64 GCC 4.7.2.

Use of another version of DevKit package to compile gems might result in compilation issues during gem installation or simply segfaults.

Look for the DevKit installers identified with the name 'DevKit-mingw64-32' and 'DevKit-mingw64-64' for 32 and 64 bits respectively.

To be clear:

    Download and install DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2 for 32bits Ruby
    Download and install DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2 for 64bits Ruby

Known Issues

There are some issues with Development Kit configuration process that fails
to detect x64 installations of Ruby. You will need to manually edit
config.yml for it to work. See the following issues for details:

Choosing 32bits vs 64bits

Before you download a 64bits version (labeled x64), it is important you understand that not all gems, libraries or tools have been tested for this version.

Things are pretty close, however it is still our recommendation you use a 32bit release.

If you have a 64bits version of Windows, you can still use 32bits, as there is no performance issue around it.
Ruby 2.2.x is brand new

While officially 2.2.x is stable, that doesn't mean all the software will magically work on it.

There were breaking bugs in 2.2.1 which didn't allow gems to be cross-compiled.
So many gems will not yet have fat binaries for Ruby 2.2.2. This situation is expected to get better soon.

Use 2.2.2 for development and verify your application, scripts and tools works properly before deciding to run this in your production environment.
Existing pre-compiled gems might not be Ruby 2.2 compatible

Ruby 2.2 introduced some C API changes which means compiled C extensions with previous versions of Ruby may not run against Ruby 2.2.

DO NOT install Ruby 2.2 on top of existing Ruby 2.1.x or earlier, or try to use compiled extensions with it.

You will be required to force compilation of those gems:

gem install <name> --platform=ruby

This will require you have the extra dependencies installed for that gem to compile. Look at the gem documentation for the requirements.

Official Announcement:

    https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2015/02/25/ruby-2-0-0-p643-is-released/

Enhancements:

    Upgraded Ruby 2.0.0 to patchlevel 643
    Update README to be in Markdown format

2.0.0-p598 (Nov 16, 2014)
Ruby 2.0.0-p598

This new version of Ruby also brings new changes to RubyInstaller.

Starting with 2.0.0, the packages will be provided in two versions:
32bits (x86) and 64bits (x64).

This is possible thanks to newer compiler provided by mingw-w64 project.

This means newer DevKit package is required to use with this version.

Please note that the installers in this release are not digitally signed.

Choosing 32bits vs 64bits

Before you download a 64bits version (labeled x64), it is important you
understand that not all gems, libraries or tools have been tested for this
version.

It is our recommendation you use 32bits until these issues are solved.

If you have a 64bits version of Windows, you can still use 32bits, as there
is no performance issue around it.
Ruby 2.0.0 is brand new

While officially 2.0.0 is stable, that doesn't mean all the software will
magically work on it.

Use 2.0.0 for development and verify your application, scripts and tools works
properly before deciding to run this in your production environment.
Existing pre-compiled gems might not be Ruby 2.0 compatible

Ruby 2.0 introduces ABI breakage which means compiled C extensions with previous
1.9.3 will not run against Ruby 2.0.

DO NOT install Ruby 2.0 on top of existing Ruby 1.9.3, or try to use compiled
extensions with it.

You will be required to force compilation of those gems:

gem install <name> --platform=ruby

This will require you have the extra dependencies installed for that gem to
compile. Look at the gem documentation for the requirements.

Please check each gem documentation and recent releases.
Do not use other DevKit version than the one recommended

This version of Ruby has been compiled and optimized for mingw-w64 GCC 4.7.2.

Use of older version of DevKit package to compile gems might result in
compilation issues during gem installation or simply segfaults.

Look for the DevKit installers identified with the name 'DevKit-mingw64-32' and
'DevKit-mingw64-64' for 32 and 64 bits respectively.

To be clear:

    For 32bits Ruby 2.0.0: download and install DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2
    For 64bits Ruby 2.0.0: download and install DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2

Known Issues

There are some issues with Development Kit configuration process that fails
to detect x64 installations of Ruby. You will need to manually edit
config.yml for it to work. See the following issues for details:

compilation issues during gem installation or simply segfaults.

Look for the DevKit installers identified with the name 'DevKit-mingw64-32' and
'DevKit-mingw64-64' for 32 and 64 bits respectively.

To be clear:

    Download and install DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2 for 32bits Ruby
    Download and install DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2 for 64bits Ruby

Known Issues

There are some issues with Development Kit configuration process that fails
to detect x64 installations of Ruby. You will need to manually edit
config.yml for it to work. See the following issues for details:

Choosing 32bits vs 64bits

Before you download a 64bits version (labeled x64), it is important you
understand that not all gems, libraries or tools have been tested for this
version.

It is our recommendation you use 32bits until these issues are solved.

If you have a 64bits version of Windows, you can still use 32bits, as there
is no performance issue around it.
Ruby 2.0.0 is brand new

While officially 2.0.0 is stable, that doesn't mean all the software will
magically work on it.

Use 2.0.0 for development and verify your application, scripts and tools works
properly before deciding to run this in your production environment.
Existing pre-compiled gems might not be Ruby 2.0 compatible

Ruby 2.0 introduces ABI breakage which means compiled C extensions with previous
1.9.3 will not run against Ruby 2.0.

DO NOT install Ruby 2.0 on top of existing Ruby 1.9.3, or try to use compiled
extensions with it.

You will be required to force compilation of those gems:

gem install <name> --platform=ruby

This will require you have the extra dependencies installed for that gem to
compile. Look at the gem documentation for the requirements.

Please check each gem documentation and recent releases.
Do not use other DevKit version than the one recommended

This version of Ruby has been compiled and optimized for mingw-w64 GCC 4.7.2.

Use of older version of DevKit package to compile gems might result in
compilation issues during gem installation or simply segfaults.

Look for the DevKit installers identified with the name 'DevKit-mingw64-32' and
'DevKit-mingw64-64' for 32 and 64 bits respectively.

To be clear:

    For 32bits Ruby 2.0.0: download and install DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2
    For 64bits Ruby 2.0.0: download and install DevKit-mingw64-64-4.7.2
